* Some header files for physical constants (speed of light, etc),
using data from the Particle Data Book. (e.g. gsl_physics.h, could
also have gsl_chemistry.h, gsl_astro.h, etc). See "astroconst" for
ideas, http://apps.freshmeat.net/homepage/953508686/

* NIST Site http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Constants/index.html
http://physics.nist.gov/PhysRefData/codata86/codata86.html

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Plan is to make a master file containing the values of the constants
and their definitions (units, description, reference, url etc).

Use a script to produce a header file of the desired values. Use "GNU
Units" to convert automatically between unit schemes (MKS, CGS, etc).

e.g. converting joules to ergs

$ units -s J ergs 
        * 10000000
        / 1e-07

use definitions like

/* Speed of light, 2.99...e8 m s^-1 */

#define GSL_CONST_SPEED_OF_LIGHT   2.99...e8  /* m s^-1 */
#define GSL_CONST_SPEED_OF_LIGHT_MKS ... (use MKS as default or make explicit??)
#define GSL_CONST_SPEED_OF_LIGHT_CGS ...

use the descriptions to add a description in the header.

TODO:
Do we want to make MKS the default or explicitly require units in macro
names?

Do we want to make error values available???

Use global constants (better for debugging, but end up being defined
in different translation units) or macros (simpler)?

Divide up by subject/unit definitions

  #include <gsl_const_atomic.h>
  #include <gsl_const_physics_cgs.h>

etc

Dear Brian,

We have this on our agenda of things to do in the future, but it may 
be a few months before we get to it.

Barry Taylor.
