This directory defines a GSL interface to BLAS functionality. GSL
exports an interface with functions of the form gsl_blas_sdsdot(...),
etc, defined in gsl_blas.h.  This act as a wrapper around a BLAS
library conforming to the C-language BLAS interface standard, "CBLAS".

Because some users will have a third party implementation of CBLAS and
some will not GSL provides a CBLAS library.

Users wanting to use the GSL CBLAS implementation will link as
  ld ... -lgsl -lgslcblas

Users wanting to use another conformant CBLAS implementation,
libcblasfoo, will link as

  ld ... -lgsl -lcblasfoo

This allows the choice of blas implementation to be deferred to
link time and obviously implies that no source code changes need
be made.

The gsl_blas interface is implemented in terms of the cblas_ interface
of the CBLAS standard.  Users who need access to BLAS functionality
but do not want to use higher-level GSL data types can write to the
cblas_ interface and still retain the ability to swap BLAS
implmentations at link time.
