Writing Mathematics in Texinfo documentation
============================================

1) To write equations using standard texinfo use the @tex .. @end tex
macros to include the TeX, then use @ifinfo ... @endinfo to include
the ASCII version which will appear in the info file.

You can take advantage of the separate TeX and ASCII versions to make
them look nice for each case.

The latest version of texi2html allows you to choose between the ASCII
equations and GIF images of the TeX equation in the HTML.

Here is an example,

    @tex
    \beforedisplay
    $$
    e = 1 + {1 \over 2!} + {1 \over 3!} + {1 \over 4!} + \dots 
      = 2.71828182846...
    $$
    \afterdisplay
    @end tex
    @ifinfo
    @example
    e = 1 + 1/2! + 1/3! + 1/4! + ... 
      = 2.71828182846...
    @end example
    @end ifinfo

Note the use of \beforedisplay ... \afterdisplay around the equation
so that the spacing for equations looks nicer.

2) For simple inline mathematics like variable names use the @math
command,

     the value of @math{x} is constrained by ...

For more complicated inline mathematics where you want to make the TeX
version different from the ASCII version use the ``@c{} hack'' to
specify the TeX alternative,

    the value of the partial derivative
    @c{$\partial_x F$}
    @math{d_x F} is constrained by the implicit ...

The ordinary comment command @c is overridden by a new macro for
handling the tex version of the math. Note that the @c{} command MUST
be followed by a newline. It is not possible to write it in the middle
of a line. This is a hack but it is unavoidable.

To write a comment use the @comment command instead

    @comment This is a comment
