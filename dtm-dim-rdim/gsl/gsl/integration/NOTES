This is a reimplementation of the double precision version of QUADPACK.
The original fortran QUADPACK is in the public domain as it was
released as part of SLATEC, which is public domain.

Bugs in the original quadpack
=============================

Notation: The use of DEFABS, RESABS and RESASC is inconsistent in DQAGSE and
DQAGPE, in the function calls to the Gauss-Kronrod integrators. I have
used the following definitions throughout,

	RESABS=integrate(|f(x)|,x,a,b) 
	RESASC=integrate(|f(x)-<f>|,x,a,b) 


DQAGPE: In the original DQAGPE the variable DEFABS is used in the loop
for in the first integral approximation. At the end of the subroutine
it is used in a divergence test. Since its value at that stage comes
from the final partition only, the test is not meaningful. The value that
should be used in the test is RESABS.

DQC25S: Around line 197 there is a summation loop which is slightly
incorrect due to a typo.

      RES12 = 0.0D+00
      RES24 = 0.0D+00
      DO 50 I=1,13
        RES12 = RES12+CHEB12(I)*RG(I)
        RES24 = RES12+CHEB24(I)*RG(I)
   50 CONTINUE

The line RES24 = RES12+CHEB24(I)*RG(I) should be RES24 = RES24+CHEB24(I)*RG(I)
to make the summation correct.

DQC25F: Around line 349 there is a summation loop which is slightly
incorrect

      RESABS = ABS(CHEB24(25))
      K = 23
      DO 150 J = 1,12
        RESC24 = RESC24+CHEB24(K)*CHEBMO(M,K)
        RESS24 = RESS24+CHEB24(K+1)*CHEBMO(M,K+1)
        RESABS = ABS(CHEB24(K))+ABS(CHEB24(K+1))
        K = K-2
  150 CONTINUE

The line RESABS = ABS(CHEB24(K))+ABS(CHEB24(K+1)) should be RESABS =
RESABS + ABS(CHEB24(K))+ABS(CHEB24(K+1)) for the sum to make sense.

DQAWFE: The accumulation of partial sums is incorrect. The current
term is added to the extrapolated value PSUM. This extrapolated value
includes an estimate of the effect of the current term, so the result
is biased. I follow the proceedure of computing the raw partial sums
and extrapolating them without any "feedback" from the extrapolation
procedure into the sum.

DQAWCE: The sign of the result should also be swapped if a > b in the
case where the integration succeeds on the initial attempt.

Testing
=======

The results of these functions should agree almost exactly with the
results from the original QUADPACK versions. I have been able to get
agreement up to the last bit (i.e. the last digit differs but the
other are ok) when small numbers of evaluations are involved.

If you want to compile the fortran versions to compare them with the
GSL versions you need to bear in mind the following points to get full
agreement:

-- The original QUADPACK does not use a consistent number of digits for
   the Gauss-Kronrod weights and abscissae. For example, the routine DQK15I
   uses only 16 digits, while DQK15 uses 33 digits. The 16 digit version 
   is rounded in decimal which leads to some discrepancies in the binary
   representations in double precision.

   I have used the full 33 digit values throughout the code. This causes 
   some differences in the results compared with the original QUADPACK, but
   the differences should be an improvement.

-- Make sure you compile everything in double precision.  i.e. use -r8,
   otherwise some float values may enter the calculation and wipe out
   your full double precision accuracy

-- If you are using an Intel chip remember that it works in extended
   precision by default. Consequently some of the tests for round-off
   produce different results than would be obtained if you were working
   to double-precision accuracy. This leads to different branches
   being taken in the code. You can use GSL_IEEE_MODE="double-precision"
   at runtime to restrict all rounding to pure double-precision accuracy

-- Make sure the machine parameters D1MACH(1)..D1MACH(4), EPMACH and UFLOW
   are set correctly. EPMACH and UFLOW need to be the same as the
   parameters DBL_EPSILON and DBL_MIN. In d1mach.f you need something like

      DATA DMACH(1) / 2.2250738585072014D-308 /
      DATA DMACH(2) / 1.7976931348623157D+308 /
      DATA DMACH(4) / 2.2204460492503131D-16  /

-- Make sure you enter double precision numbers as 1.0d-23 and not 1.0e-23 
   if you are using f2c.

   If you type 1.0e-23 as an argument then f2c may cast it from (float *)
   to (double *) which gives a completely bogus result.  Since there are
   no header files in f2c's Fortran you can't catch this error.

This problem caused me to waste a lot of time, here is an example:

bjg|zeke> cat main.f

    program main
    call foo(1.23e0)
    end

bjg|zeke> cat foo.f 
    subroutine foo(x)
    double precision x
    print *,"x = ",x
    return
    end 

bjg|zeke> fort77 main.f foo.f       (fort77 is an f2c front end)
    MAIN main:
    foo:

bjg|zeke> ./a.out 
 x =   1.96252698E-313        (Doh! We have to use 1.23d0 to make it work)
